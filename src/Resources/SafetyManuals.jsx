          Our safety manuals ensure compliance with international standards.
          They outline workplace safety protocols, hazard control procedures,
          PPE regulations, and emergency response strategies adopted across our
          project sites.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Each manual is designed to guide our engineers, technicians, and
          on-site personnel through real-time safety assessments, accident
          prevention measures, and emergency drills tailored to specific
          environments.

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          At Parker Integrated Engineering LTD, we believe that safety is not an
          optionâ€”it is a core value. Our manuals are regularly reviewed and
          updated to align with evolving standards and technologies, ensuring
          that everyone goes home safe every day.
